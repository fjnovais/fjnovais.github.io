<b>Abstract</b>

Background: Advancements in metabolomic technologies have revolutionized our understanding of feed efficiency (FE) in livestock, offering new pathways to enhance both profitability and sustainability in ruminant production. Methods: This review offers a critical and systematic evaluation of the metabolomics methods used to measure and assess FE in ruminants. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, covering publications from 1971 to 2023. This review synthesizes findings from 71 studies that applied metabolomic approaches to uncover the biological mechanisms driving interindividual variations in FE across cattle, sheep, goats, and buffaloes. Results: Most studies focused on cattle and employed targeted metabolomics to identify key biomarkers, including amino acids, fatty acids, and other metabolites linked to critical pathways such as energy metabolism, nitrogen utilization, and muscle development. Despite promising insights, challenges remain, including small sample sizes, methodological inconsistencies, and a lack of validation studies, particularly for non-cattle species. Conclusions: By leveraging state-of-the-art metabolomic methods, this review highlights the potential of metabolomics to provide cost-effective, non-invasive molecular markers for FE evaluation, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable livestock management. Future research should prioritize larger, species-specific studies with standardized methods to validate identified biomarkers and enhance practical applications in livestock production systems.
