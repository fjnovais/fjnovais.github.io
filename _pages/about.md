Hello! I'm Francisco, an animal scientist, MSc. & Ph.D. in animal science and pastures at the University of São Paulo (USP). I have experience in Bioinformatics and Data Science. **Recently, I've been working with Precision Livestock Farming (Papers coming soon)**. During my Ph.D., at the University of São Paulo, I focused on Multi-omics integration methods applied to meat tenderness in Nellore cattle. In my MSc. research, I committed to identifying potential biomarkers associated with feed efficiency and understanding the molecular process that explains feed efficiency variation.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy cooking, drawing, and spending time with family.

**This website is not updated- I`ll update it soon!!!**
