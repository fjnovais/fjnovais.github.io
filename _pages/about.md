Hello! I’m Francisco, an animal scientist, MSc. & Ph.D. in animal science and pastures, and MBA in Data Science and Analytics at the University of São Paulo (USP). Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Alberta, Canada, focusing on Precision Livestock Farming and Sustainable Animal Production. 

With a multidisciplinary background, I have contributed to several research labs at USP, including the Animal Biotechnology Laboratory (ESALQ), the Comparative and Translational Oncology Laboratory (LOCT), and the Animal Breeding, Biotechnology, and Transgenics Group (GMABT). My work spans metabolomics applied to animal production, systems biology, and omics data integration.

I have strong expertise in genetics, molecular biology, data science, and sustainable production practices. From 2013 to 2014, I worked as a Technical Assistant at CRV Lagoa Ltd., managing the database for the Genetic Improvement Program "Gestor Leite" and the directed breeding program "SIREMATCH" for dairy cattle.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy cooking, drawing, and spending time with family.
